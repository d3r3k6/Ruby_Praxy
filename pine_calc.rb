Write a program which tells you: 
how many hours are in a year? 
how many minutes are in a decade? 
how many seconds old are you? 
=end
    
#This will calculate hours in a year
puts 24*365

#This calculates minutes in a decade
puts 60*24*365*10

#This calculates how many seconds old
puts (32*365*24*60) + (120*24*60)
