#This program evaluates the answer to the Euler Project Problem 2
=begin
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#Generate a Fibonacci sequence and store in an array such that [-1] > four million
#lamda an expression to total the evn sumbers

#the most ruby way to generate a fibonacci sequence is through memoization
#first a hash which will five you the specificed value of the sequence
